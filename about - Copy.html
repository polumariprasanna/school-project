    Pre-school
</h1>
<p>
    Pre-school years are the formative years of a child’s schooling. "The play way US method" is used for tiny tots. This helps to develop a spirit of enquiry in young minds and gently lead them to the path of learning through activities, all of which are both fun and educative. We consider it imperative to create a vibrant child friendly surrounding which provide a conducive atmosphere to capture every child’s imagination and stimulate learning. The curricular framework for pre-school is designed around various skills like life skills, Eye Hand co-ordination & Motor skills, Language and Numerical skills, Sensorial skills, Social, Emotional and Aesthetic skills, Cultural Activities and various performing arts.

Primary
</h1>
<p>
Primary education is all about stimulating the learner’s senses. Our infrastructure and our teaching methodology allows us to help children to develop their senses with interactive puzzles, group exercises and other activities apart from the knowledge from the books with standard checks and basic tests to ensure progress. The primary section comprises of classes 1 to 5. MGM International School endeavors to provide a strong foundation for an all-round development of a child, a holistic education and hence, emphasis is on qualitative teaching and learning process so that every child who enters the portals of this school has a stress free learning atmosphere and is gradually prepared to meet life head-on. Primary curriculum emphasizes on developing concepts and strives for a balanced development of a child with the four key elements being knowledge, skills, habits and attitude.

Secondary  
</h1>
<p>
    After Standard V, students are gradually encouraged to focus more on academics which makes them competitive and enables them to strive towards excellence. In CBSE learning is through experiments, projects, observation, field trips, explorations, group discussions and research based projects and many more activities. We follow activity based and interactive learning. The motive behind the activity based approach is that children are the doers. They learn and comprehend better because their interest is aroused and remember well as they have encountered and used it in a realistic situation. It aims developing the child’s intellect and thought process.

The CBSE section of MGM International School will be having its first batch of X in the academic year 2017-18.

    Faculty
</h1>
<p>
    The Faculty is being progressively guided by the management. Through periodic training, attempt has been made to combine the traditional teaching methods with the multi-directional modern tools and techniques. This helps to evolve a conducive teaching methodology and to sensitize the teachers towards the curriculum actualization. Such an approach helps them to modify their teaching strategies and to evolve and grow beyond, which will in turn help them bring out the best in the children also.
